The __duration__ package supports fitting statistical models for event
time data (also known as "survival analysis") in Go.  Currently, Cox
proportional hazards regression, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the
marginal survival function, and estimation of the cumulative incidence
function are supported.

The Godoc package documentation is [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/kshedden/statmodel/duration).

See the examples directory for illustrations of how the package can be used.
