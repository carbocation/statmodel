__statmodel__ is a set of type definitions and generic functions to
support [Go](http://golang.org) packages that fit statistical models.
It does not implement any specific statistical models.  Some other
packages that use this package to fit specific families of statistical
models are:

* [goglm](http://github.com/kshedden/goglm) for Generalized Linear
Models

* [duration](http://github.com/kshedden/duration) for Cox proportional
  hazards regression models
